Conway' Game of life is a simulation written in JavaScript.  It is a standalone program that doesn't require an HTTP server.  Just run it in a web browser by double clicking ConwaysGameOfLife.html.  A grid depicts a village of neighbors.  A blue check box means the neighbor is alive; a red unchecked box means the neighbor is dead.  The program can be single stepped by clicking on the "Next generation" button.  It can run continuously by clicking on "Auto run."  A neighbor survives if it has two or three neighbors who are alive; otherwise it dies.  A dead neighbor can be brought back to life if it acquires three neighbors who are alive.  In the single step  mode, 
you can check a box on or off.  The program runs until the conditions mentioned above are satisfied.
